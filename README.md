# Sonic Unleashed PS2 Hacks

Here are some of my hacks made for Unleashed PS2 during a quick session of screwing around.

## TODO:

- figure out time scaling issues

- remap actions to other buttons

- port to other regions (currently only SLES-55380 PAL-E is supported)

- figure out UI scaling for widescreen
